# SDC (Secure Data Compiler)

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST** and only fallback to additional search and context gathering if the information in these instructions is incomplete or found to be in error.

SDC is a Secure Data Compiler project that is currently in its initial development phase. This repository contains minimal code and is being actively developed.

## Current Repository State

**CRITICAL: Repository is in early development phase.**
- The repository currently contains only a README.md file
- No source code, build systems, or dependencies are present yet
- No build or test commands are available to run
- The project structure and technology stack are not yet established

## Working Effectively

### Repository Setup
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CoParentPro/SDC.git`
- Navigate to the repository: `cd SDC`
- **Current contents**: Only README.md exists

### Development Workflow (When Code is Added)
The following commands are placeholders for when the project structure is established:

**Bootstrap steps (TO BE VALIDATED WHEN CODE EXISTS):**
- Install dependencies: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Configure environment: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Initialize development environment: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`

**Build commands (TO BE VALIDATED WHEN CODE EXISTS):**
- Build the project: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- **Expected build time**: Unknown until implementation
- **NEVER CANCEL**: Set timeout to 60+ minutes when build system is implemented

**Test commands (TO BE VALIDATED WHEN CODE EXISTS):**
- Run unit tests: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Run integration tests: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- **Expected test time**: Unknown until implementation
- **NEVER CANCEL**: Set timeout to 30+ minutes when test suite is implemented

### Current Limitations
- **Cannot build**: No build system exists yet
- **Cannot test**: No test framework exists yet
- **Cannot run**: No executable code exists yet
- **Cannot validate functionality**: No application logic exists yet

## Security Considerations

Since this is a "Secure Data Compiler", when development begins:
- Always follow secure coding practices
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate encryption for sensitive data
- Review code for security vulnerabilities before committing

## Validation Requirements

**Current validation steps:**
- Ensure README.md is properly formatted
- Verify repository structure follows conventions
- Check that new files follow naming conventions

**Future validation steps (when code exists):**
- Run all build commands successfully
- Execute complete test suite
- Perform security scans
- Validate compiler output correctness
- Test end-to-end compilation workflows

## Common Tasks

### Current Repository Structure
```
SDC/
├── .git/
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md
└── README.md
```

### Frequently Used Commands (Current)
- View repository status: `git status`
- Check current files: `ls -la`
- View README: `cat README.md`

### Future Common Tasks (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
- Compile source files: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Run compiler on test data: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Generate output reports: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`
- Validate compiled output: `[COMMAND NOT YET AVAILABLE]`

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Code
- Update these instructions with actual build/test/run commands
- Validate all commands before documenting them
- Include timing information for long-running operations
- Add specific security validation steps
- Document any special requirements or dependencies

### Code Quality
- Follow established coding standards (to be defined)
- Include comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Document security implications of changes
- Perform code reviews before merging

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Current state**: No CI/CD pipeline implemented yet

**Future pipeline (when implemented):**
- Automated builds on pull requests
- Security scanning
- Test execution
- Code quality checks
- Deployment automation

## Important Notes

- **This is a foundational instruction set** that must be updated as the project develops
- **All build/test commands are placeholders** until actual implementation
- **Security is a primary concern** for this compiler project
- **Always validate new instructions** by running commands before documenting them
- **Update timing estimates** based on actual performance when code exists

## Next Steps for Repository Development

1. Define project technology stack
2. Implement basic project structure
3. Add build system configuration
4. Create test framework
5. Implement core compiler functionality
6. Update these instructions with actual working commands
7. Add comprehensive validation scenarios

**Remember**: These instructions are a living document that must be updated as the SDC project evolves from its current minimal state to a fully functional secure data compiler.
